# Lesson 1: What is Agentic AI?

## Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson of the Agentic AI course! In this lesson, we will explore the fundamental question: What is Agentic AI?

## Defining Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are **agents**. An agent is a system that can perceive its environment, reason about its observations, and act to achieve specific goals. In simpler terms, an agent is an AI that can **do things** on its own.

### Key Characteristics of an AI Agent:

*   **Autonomy:** Agents can operate independently without direct human control.
*   **Reactivity:** Agents can perceive their environment and respond to changes in it.
*   **Proactiveness:** Agents can take initiative to achieve their goals.
*   **Goal-oriented:** Agents have specific goals that they are trying to achieve.

## How is Agentic AI Different?

Traditional AI models, like those used for image classification or language translation, are typically **passive**. They receive an input and produce an output. For example, you give a model an image, and it tells you what's in it.

Agentic AI, on the other hand, is **active**. It has a goal and can take a series of actions to achieve that goal. It can interact with its environment, use tools, and even create new plans to overcome obstacles.

## Example

Imagine you want to book a flight. A traditional AI might be able to answer the question, "What are the cheapest flights to New York?" An agentic AI, however, could be given the goal, "Book the cheapest flight to New York for me," and it would then go through the entire process of searching for flights, selecting the best option, and booking the ticket on your behalf.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've defined Agentic AI and highlighted its key characteristics. In the next lesson, we'll delve into the history and evolution of AI agents.
