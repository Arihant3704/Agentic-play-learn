## Introduction

In this final assignment, you will have the opportunity to bring together everything you have learned in this course to design an innovative smart mobility solution. This is your chance to be creative and to think like an entrepreneur, a designer, and an engineer.

## The Challenge

Your task is to develop a concept for a new product or service that leverages Agentic AI to address a critical challenge in the mobility industry. Your project should be aligned with the theme of "Innovating the Future of Smart Mobility" and should incorporate one or more of the following technologies:

*   Agentic AI
*   Generative AI
*   IoT
*   Embedded Software
*   Cloud
*   Digital Twin
*   AR/VR

## Project Ideas

You are free to choose any project that you are passionate about. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

*   **An AI-powered co-pilot for elderly or disabled drivers:** This agent could provide enhanced driver assistance, monitor the driver's health, and automatically call for help in an emergency.
*   **A personalized in-car experience for families:** This agent could learn the preferences of each family member and provide personalized entertainment, navigation, and comfort settings.
*   **A gamified driver coaching system:** This agent could use AR/VR to create an immersive and engaging experience that helps drivers to improve their skills and to drive more safely and efficiently.
*   **A sustainable mobility platform:** This agent could help users to make more sustainable transportation choices by providing real-time information about public transit, bike sharing, and electric vehicle charging stations.
*   **An intelligent manufacturing system for electric vehicles:** This agent could use computer vision and machine learning to optimize the manufacturing process, reduce waste, and improve quality.

## Submission Requirements

Your submission should be a project proposal that includes the following sections:

1.  **Project Title:** A catchy and descriptive title for your project.
2.  **Problem Statement:** A clear and concise description of the problem that you are trying to solve.
