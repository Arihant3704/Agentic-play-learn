# Lesson 3: Designing an Edge-First, H-AI System

## A New Design Paradigm
When designing for the edge with novel H-AI in mind, our approach needs to change. We are not just designing an app; we are designing a continuous, context-aware experience.

## The Blueprint for an Edge Agent

Let's design a hypothetical agent that embodies these principles. Imagine an **"AI Study Buddy"** for a student.

1.  **The Problem:** Students are often distracted, lose track of time, and struggle to find relevant information quickly.

2.  **The Edge-First Agentic Solution:** An on-device agent that runs on the student's laptop or tablet.

3.  **Novel H-AI in Action:**
    *   **Context-Awareness:** The agent knows the student's class schedule and assignment deadlines. It sees what applications are open (e.g., a web browser, a code editor, a PDF of a textbook).
    *   **Proactivity:** If the agent sees the student has been on social media for 30 minutes and a major assignment is due tomorrow, it might gently intervene: "Hey, just a reminder that the history paper is due tomorrow. I've pulled up the relevant chapters in your textbook and your class notes. Ready to jump back in?"
    *   **Implicit Intent & Multimodality:** The agent sees that the student is highlighting text in their digital textbook (vision/input). It can implicitly understand this is important. It could then automatically use a tool to search the web for related articles or create a flashcard for that highlighted term.
    *   **Low Latency & Privacy:** Because it runs on-device, it can react instantly to the student switching applications. All the student's documents and browsing history remain private.

## The Technical Architecture
-   **Core Logic (Gemma 3n on-device):** The reasoning engine that decides when and how to intervene.
-   **Tools (On-Device):**
    *   `ScreenReaderTool`: A tool that can see the text and UI elements of the applications the user has open.
    *   `CalendarAPI` and `FileManagerAPI`: Tools to access local files and schedules.
    *   `NotificationTool`: A tool to create the pop-up notifications.

This design creates an agent that is deeply integrated into the user's workflow, acting as a proactive and intelligent partner rather than a simple, reactive tool.
