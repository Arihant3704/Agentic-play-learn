# Module 9 Assignment: Design the Next Generation of H-AI

## Introduction
This final, capstone assignment challenges you to synthesize everything you have learned in this course. Your task is to design an innovative, on-device agentic AI solution that pioneers a new form of Human-AI Interaction (H-AI).

## The Challenge
Develop a detailed concept for a new product or service that leverages **on-device Generative AI** to solve a real-world problem. The core of your proposal must be a novel, effective, and intuitive H-AI model.

### Project Ideas (to get you started)

1.  **The AI Sous-Chef:** An agent that watches you cook via a kitchen camera, identifies ingredients as you use them, and provides real-time, hands-free guidance. It could adapt a recipe if it sees you substitute an ingredient or suggest the next step without you having to ask.
2.  **The AR Language Tutor:** An agent on your phone that uses the camera to see the world. Point at an object, and the agent tells you the word for it in the language you're learning, then helps you practice pronunciation. The interaction is with the world, not just a screen.
3.  **The Smart Garden Guardian:** An on-device agent connected to a camera and soil sensors. It proactively sends notifications with pictures: "The tomatoes in the back row look a bit thirsty," or "I've identified a pest on your basil plant. Here is an organic solution."
4.  **The Adaptive Workout Coach:** An agent on a smartwatch or phone that uses the camera to analyze your exercise form (e.g., squats, push-ups), providing real-time auditory feedback ("Lower your hips a bit more"). It also monitors heart rate to proactively suggest intensity changes or rest periods.
5.  **The Mindful Work Companion:** An on-device agent for a laptop that monitors application usage. If it detects signs of distraction (frequent task-switching) or stress (rapid typing and deleting), it might gently suggest a 5-minute breathing exercise.
6.  **The "Remember This" Audio Journal:** A wearable agent that is always listening (on-device for privacy). The user can say a trigger word like, "Aura, remember this," and the agent saves the last 30 seconds of audio. Later, the user can ask, "What was my idea about the marketing plan?" and the agent retrieves the relevant snippet using semantic search.
7.  **The Interactive Storyteller for Kids:** An agent on a tablet that uses the camera to see a child's toys. The child can place a toy dinosaur in front of the camera, and the agent weaves it into an ongoing, personalized story, generating new plot points based on the objects it sees.
8.  **The Social Confidence Coach:** A wearable agent that uses a microphone to analyze the user's speech patterns (e.g., speed, volume, use of filler words) in a social setting. It can provide gentle, private haptic feedback on a smartwatch to remind the user to slow down or speak more clearly.
9.  **The Musician's Practice Partner:** An agent on a tablet that listens to someone practicing an instrument. It can identify the piece of music, turn the pages of the digital sheet music automatically, and offer to play the accompaniment if it detects the user is struggling with tempo.
10. **The AR Car Manual:** An agent in a car's infotainment system or a phone app. The user points their camera at a part of the engine bay, and the agent overlays information about what the part is and links to a video tutorial on how to perform simple maintenance (like refilling washer fluid).
11. **The "Focus Mode" Environment Manager:** An agent for a smart home. When the user says, "I need to focus for an hour," the agent dims the lights, sets the thermostat, silences phone notifications, and plays a focus-enhancing playlist, all based on learned preferences.
12. **The Elder Care Companion:** An agent on a dedicated home device for an elderly person. It uses vision to detect if the user has fallen and can automatically call for help. It also proactively reminds them to take medication when it sees them enter the kitchen around their scheduled pill time.
13. **The DIY Project Assistant:** An AR agent on a phone or smart glasses. The user points the camera at their DIY project (e.g., assembling furniture). The agent identifies the current step in the manual, highlights the correct screw to use, and overlays an animation of how the pieces fit together.
14. **The Commute De-Stressor:** An agent that combines data from the user's calendar, traffic APIs, and a wearable heart-rate monitor. If it detects high stress levels during a heavy traffic commute, it might suggest, "Traffic is bad today. Let's try a relaxing podcast instead of the news. Okay?"
15. **The Personalized Museum Guide:** An AR agent on a phone. As you look at an exhibit, the agent uses vision to identify it and provides information tailored to your interests, which it has learned over time. It could tell a child a fun story about a painting, but give an art history student details about the brush strokes.

## Submission Requirements

Your submission should be a project proposal that includes the following sections:

1.  **Project Title:** A catchy and descriptive title.
2.  **The Problem:** A clear description of the real-world problem you are solving.
3.  **The On-Device Agent:**
    *   Describe your agent and its core purpose.
    *   Explain why running this agent **on the edge** is critical for its success (referencing latency, privacy, or offline capabilities).
4.  **The Novel Human-AI Interaction (H-AI):**
    *   This is the most important section. Describe the interaction model. How is it proactive, context-aware, multimodal, or based on implicit intent?
    *   Explain why this new form of interaction is more effective and intuitive than a traditional app or voice assistant.
5.  **Technical Architecture:**
    *   A high-level diagram or description of your system.
    *   List the core components, including the on-device LLM (e.g., Gemma 3n) and the specialized tools the agent would need to perceive and act on its environment.

## Evaluation Criteria
-   **Innovation in H-AI:** How creative and effective is your proposed interaction model?
-   **Impact:** How well does your solution address a real-world problem?
-   **Edge-First Rationale:** How strong is your justification for building this as an on-device AI system?

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your vision for the future of Human-AI Interaction!
