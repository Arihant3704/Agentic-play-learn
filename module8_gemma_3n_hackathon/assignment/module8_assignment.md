# Module 8 Assignment: AI Co-Pilot Project Proposal

## Introduction
This assignment is the culmination of our project-focused module. Your task is to create a detailed project proposal for the **AI Co-Pilot** agent, "Axel," as designed in the preceding lessons. This proposal should be written as if you were submitting it to the Gemma 3n Impact Challenge.

## The Task
Using the architecture and concepts from the "Deep Dive Case Study," create a comprehensive project proposal that includes the following sections:

1.  **Project Title:** AI Co-Pilot "Axel": A Proactive In-Car Agent for Enhanced Safety and Efficiency
2.  **The Problem:** Describe the challenges modern drivers face, including cognitive load from managing vehicle systems, navigation, and unexpected road conditions. Emphasize the need for a proactive assistant that anticipates problems rather than just reacting to commands.
3.  **The Solution (The AI Co-Pilot Agent):**
    *   Provide a detailed description of the agent, "Axel."
    *   Explain its core function: to act as a proactive co-pilot that monitors vehicle, route, and weather data to provide timely advice.
    *   Detail the role of Gemma 3n as the **reasoning core** that synthesizes data from multiple sources to make intelligent judgments.
    *   Describe the three primary tools: the `VehicleAPI`, the `NavigationAPI`, and the `WeatherAPI`.
4.  **Impact:** Explain the potential positive impact. How would this agent improve driver safety by reducing distraction? How could it improve efficiency for EV owners by managing range anxiety?
5.  **Technical Writeup:**
    *   Present the high-level technical architecture (as described in the case study).
    *   Specify the key technologies you would use (e.g., Python, a simulated car environment or an API like the Smartcar API, a maps API, a weather API).
    *   Outline a brief plan for building the prototype: (1) Develop mock APIs for the vehicle, navigation, and weather tools, (2) Implement the Gemma 3n prompt and reasoning loop, (3) Create a simple text-based interface to show the agent's proactive suggestions.
6.  **Video Demo Plan:**
    *   Create a short, 3-5 panel storyboard or a script for a 2-minute video. It should show a driver on a trip and how Axel proactively provides a useful suggestion (e.g., the EV charging scenario).

## Submission
Please submit your project proposal as a PDF document. This assignment is designed to give you a complete, well-structured plan that you could theoretically use to enter the hackathon. Good luck!
