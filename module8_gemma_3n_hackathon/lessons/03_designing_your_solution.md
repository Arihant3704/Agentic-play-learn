# Lesson 3: Designing the AI Co-Pilot

## From Idea to Blueprint
Let's design our AI Co-Pilot. A solid plan will clarify its role, how the driver interacts with it, and the technical components needed.

## Key Design Components for the AI Co-Pilot

### 1. The Agent's Role and Persona
- **Role:** A proactive, intelligent co-pilot focused on safety, efficiency, and convenience.
- **Persona:** We'll call it "Axel." Axel should be calm, competent, and concise. Its voice should be clear and non-intrusive.

### 2. The User Journey (Example Scenario)
- **Context:** The user is on a long road trip in an electric vehicle (EV).
- **Proactive Alert:** Axel speaks without being prompted: "Hi, just a heads-up. Based on your current speed and the upcoming hilly terrain, your estimated battery at arrival is down to 5%. There's a fast-charging station in 10 miles that is currently available. I recommend we add a 15-minute stop. Should I update the navigation?"
- **User Interaction:** The user replies, "Yes, please do."
- **Action:** Axel updates the car's navigation system with the new stop.

### 3. Technical Architecture
- **Core Logic (Gemma 3n):** Gemma is the brain. It will receive structured data from multiple tools (vehicle status, route, weather) and decide *when* to speak and *what* to say. Its job is to synthesize information into actionable insights.
- **Tools:** The agent needs access to several APIs and data sources:
    1.  **`VehicleAPI`:** A tool to get real-time data from the car (e.g., speed, battery level, tire pressure, odometer).
    2.  **`NavigationAPI`:** A tool to get the current route, traffic conditions, and locations of interest (like charging stations).
    3.  **`WeatherAPI`:** A tool to get current and forecasted weather for the route.

## Your Task
Before our deep dive, think about the agent's memory. What information should the AI Co-Pilot remember long-term about the driver (e.g., driving style, typical commute) to provide even more personalized advice? Write a short paragraph with your ideas.
