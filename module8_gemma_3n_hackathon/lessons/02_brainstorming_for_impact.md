# Lesson 2: Brainstorming for Automotive Impact

## Finding a Problem on the Road
The first step is to identify a meaningful problem to solve within the smart mobility and automotive space. The Gemma 3n challenge is about real-world impact.

Consider these areas:
- **Safety:** How can we prevent accidents or reduce driver distraction?
- **Convenience:** How can we make the driving experience smoother and more enjoyable?
- **Efficiency:** How can we help drivers save fuel (or battery charge) and time?
- **Accessibility:** How can we make driving more accessible for elderly or disabled users?

## Ideation for an In-Car Agent
Think about what an **active, agentic co-pilot** could do, beyond just responding to commands.

**Good Idea:** "An AI Co-Pilot that proactively monitors vehicle data, weather, and traffic to provide safety alerts and suggest route changes. For example: 'It's starting to rain heavily, and your tires are a bit worn. I suggest reducing your speed. There's also an accident reported ahead; I can reroute you to save 10 minutes.'"
*This is agentic because it perceives multiple data streams (vehicle sensors, weather API, traffic API), reasons about the combined data, and acts by providing proactive, contextual advice.*

**Less Agentic Idea:** "A voice assistant that can play music or set a destination."
*This is a standard command-response system, not a proactive agent.*

## Your Task
In the following lessons, we will develop the "AI Co-Pilot" idea into a full project proposal, perfect for the Gemma 3n Challenge.
