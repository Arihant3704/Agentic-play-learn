# Module 8: The Gemma 3n Impact Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to a special, project-based module! Here, we will take the concepts of Agentic AI and apply them to a real-world competition: the **Google - The Gemma 3n Impact Challenge** on Kaggle. This module is designed to guide you through the process of conceptualizing, designing, and prototyping a project for this hackathon.

## The Challenge Overview
The goal of the Gemma 3n Impact Challenge is to use Google's new Gemma 3n model to build innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on the world. The competition encourages projects in areas like accessibility, education, and healthcare.

## Why this fits our course?
This hackathon is a perfect practical application of everything we've learned:
- It's centered around a powerful new LLM (Gemma 3n), the "brain" of our agents.
- It requires you to think about how an AI can "do things" to solve a real problem.
- It encourages the integration of tools and APIs to create a complete product.

Let's get started!
