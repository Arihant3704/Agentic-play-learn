# Lesson 1: Introduction to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

## What is a UAV?
An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which include a UAV, a ground-based controller, and a system of communications between the two.

## Types of UAVs
- **Fixed-Wing UAVs:** Similar to traditional airplanes, they are efficient for long-distance and high-speed flights.
- **Rotary-Wing UAVs:** These are helicopters or multi-rotor drones (like quadcopters). They can hover, take off and land vertically, and are highly maneuverable.
- **Hybrid UAVs:** Combine features of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, aiming to get the best of both worlds.

## Key Components of a UAV
- **Airframe:** The body of the UAV.
- **Propulsion System:** Motors, propellers, and power source (usually batteries).
- **Flight Controller:** The onboard computer that stabilizes the UAV and executes flight commands.
- **Sensors:** GPS, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), cameras, and other specialized sensors (e.g., thermal, multispectral).
- **Payload:** The equipment carried by the UAV for its specific mission (e.g., a camera for photography, a package for delivery).

## Applications of UAVs
- **Aerial Photography and Videography:** Real estate, filmmaking, and journalism.
- **Infrastructure Inspection:** Power lines, wind turbines, and bridges.
- **Agriculture:** Crop monitoring and precision spraying.
- **Delivery Services:** Last-mile delivery of packages and medical supplies.
- **Search and Rescue:** Locating missing persons in remote areas.
