# Lesson 3: UAV Swarm Intelligence

## What is a UAV Swarm?
A UAV swarm is a group of multiple UAVs that work together to achieve a common goal. The key idea is that the swarm can accomplish tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single UAV.

## The Power of Collaboration
By coordinating their actions, a swarm of UAVs can:
- **Cover a larger area:** For search and rescue or agricultural mapping, a swarm can cover a large area much faster than a single drone.
- **Be more resilient:** If one UAV in the swarm fails, the others can adapt and continue the mission.
- **Perform complex tasks:** A swarm could be used to create complex 3D models of buildings or to create intricate light displays in the sky.

## Agentic AI for Swarm Coordination
Coordinating a swarm is a perfect application for multi-agent systems.

- **Decentralized Control:** Each UAV in the swarm can have its own agent. These agents communicate with each other to make decisions. There is no single point of failure.
- **Emergent Behavior:** The complex behavior of the swarm emerges from the simple rules and interactions of the individual agents. For example, each agent might follow three simple rules: 
    1.  Maintain a minimum distance from other UAVs.
    2.  Match the average heading of neighboring UAVs.
    3.  Move towards the average position of neighboring UAVs.
- **Task Allocation:** A central "manager" agent (or a distributed consensus algorithm) can assign different tasks to different UAVs in the swarm. For example, in a search and rescue mission, different UAVs could be assigned to search different sectors of an area.

## Challenges in Swarm Intelligence
- **Communication:** Reliable communication between the UAVs is essential for coordination.
- **Collision Avoidance:** Each agent must be able to avoid collisions with other agents in the swarm.
- **Scalability:** The coordination strategy must be able to scale to a large number of UAVs.
