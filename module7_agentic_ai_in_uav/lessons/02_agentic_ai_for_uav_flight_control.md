# Lesson 2: Agentic AI for UAV Flight Control

## The Complexity of UAV Flight
Controlling a UAV, especially a multi-rotor drone, is a complex task. It requires constant adjustments to the speed of multiple motors to maintain stability and achieve desired movements. While basic flight controllers handle this low-level stability, agentic AI can provide a higher level of intelligent control.

## Agentic AI in the Cockpit
An agentic AI can act as an intelligent pilot, capable of more than just following waypoints.

- **Advanced Maneuvers:** An agent can be trained to perform complex acrobatic maneuvers that would be difficult for a human pilot.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Using computer vision and other sensors, an agent can detect and dynamically avoid obstacles like birds, buildings, or other UAVs. This is crucial for safe operation, especially in urban environments.
- **Energy-Aware Flight:** The agent can plan its flight path and adjust its speed to maximize battery life, ensuring it can complete its mission and return safely.
- **Adapting to Environmental Changes:** If the agent detects strong winds or rain, it can adjust its flight plan and control strategy to maintain stability and safety.

## Example: A Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Scenario
1.  **Mission:** The UAV is flying a pre-planned route to deliver a package.
2.  **Perceive:** The agent's camera feed detects a flock of birds directly in its flight path.
3.  **Reason:** The agent reasons that continuing on the current path would be dangerous. It needs to find a new path.
4.  **Act:** The agent invokes a local path planning tool. It might decide to momentarily hover, let the birds pass, and then continue. Or, it might plot a new course around the flock.
5.  **Execute:** The agent sends the new commands to the flight controller to execute the avoidance maneuver.
