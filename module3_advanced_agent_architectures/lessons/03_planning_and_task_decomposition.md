# Lesson 3: Planning and Task Decomposition

## Introduction

One of the hallmarks of an intelligent agent is its ability to take a high-level goal and figure out the steps needed to achieve it. This process is known as **planning and task decomposition**. In this lesson, we will explore how AI agents can create and execute plans to solve complex problems.

## What is Planning?

In the context of AI, planning is the process of generating a sequence of actions that will lead to a desired goal. A plan is like a roadmap that guides the agent's behavior. For a simple goal, the plan might be a single action. For a more complex goal, the plan could be a long and intricate sequence of steps.

## Task Decomposition

Task decomposition is the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. This is a crucial step in the planning process, as it allows the agent to focus on one part of the problem at a time.

For example, if the agent's goal is to "organize a birthday party," it might decompose this task into the following sub-tasks:

1.  Create a guest list.
2.  Send out invitations.
3.  Order a cake.
4.  Plan the decorations.
5.  Arrange for entertainment.

Each of these sub-tasks can then be further decomposed into even smaller steps.

## Planning Techniques for AI Agents

There are several techniques that AI agents can use to create plans. Here are a few common approaches:

### 1. Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain of Thought is a simple yet powerful technique where the agent is prompted to "think step by step." By breaking down its reasoning process into a series of intermediate steps, the agent can often arrive at a more accurate and well-reasoned plan. This is a very common technique used with large language models.

### 2. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

Tree of Thoughts is a more advanced technique that extends the idea of Chain of Thought. Instead of just generating a single chain of thought, the agent explores multiple reasoning paths at once, creating a tree of possible thoughts. The agent can then evaluate these different paths and choose the most promising one to follow.

### 3. ReAct (Reason and Act)

ReAct is a framework that combines reasoning and acting. The agent alternates between thinking about the problem (reasoning) and taking actions to gather more information (acting). This allows the agent to build a plan incrementally and adapt its plan based on the results of its actions.

## Example: Planning a Trip

Let's say you give an agent the goal: "Plan a weekend trip to Paris for me."

Here's how the agent might use planning and task decomposition to achieve this goal:

1.  **Decomposition:** The agent first breaks down the goal into sub-tasks:
    *   Find flights to Paris.
    *   Book a hotel in Paris.
    *   Create an itinerary of things to do in Paris.

2.  **Planning (for each sub-task):**
    *   **Flights:** The agent might use a flight booking tool to search for flights, compare prices, and find the best option.
    *   **Hotel:** The agent might use a hotel booking tool to find a hotel that meets your preferences (e.g., price, location, amenities).
    *   **Itinerary:** The agent might use a search tool to find popular attractions in Paris and then create a suggested itinerary for the weekend.

3.  **Execution:** The agent would then execute this plan, interacting with the necessary tools and presenting you with the final trip plan.

## Conclusion

Planning and task decomposition are essential skills for any advanced AI agent. By breaking down complex problems and creating a plan of action, agents can tackle a wide range of tasks that would be impossible to solve with a single action. In the next lesson, we will explore how agents can be given access to a wide variety of tools and APIs to enhance their capabilities.
