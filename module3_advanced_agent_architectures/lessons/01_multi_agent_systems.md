# Lesson 1: Multi-Agent Systems

## Introduction

In the previous modules, we focused on building and interacting with single AI agents. However, some problems are too complex or multifaceted for a single agent to solve effectively. This is where **multi-agent systems** come into play.

## What are Multi-Agent Systems?

A multi-agent system (MAS) is a system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. These agents can be homogeneous or heterogeneous, meaning they can have the same or different capabilities and goals. The key idea behind MAS is that by having multiple agents collaborate, compete, or coexist, we can achieve more complex and robust behaviors than with a single agent.

## Why Use Multi-Agent Systems?

There are several advantages to using a multi-agent approach:

*   **Modularity:** By breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, we can assign each sub-problem to a different agent. This makes the system easier to design, develop, and maintain.
*   **Scalability:** Multi-agent systems can be easily scaled by adding more agents to the system.
*   **Robustness and Reliability:** If one agent fails, the other agents in the system can potentially take over its tasks, making the system more resilient to failures.
*   **Parallelism:** Multiple agents can work in parallel to solve a problem faster.
*   **Specialization:** We can create specialized agents that are experts in a particular domain. For example, in a software development team, we could have a planning agent, a coding agent, a testing agent, and a debugging agent.

## Architectures for Multi-Agent Systems

There are several ways to structure the interaction between agents in a multi-agent system. Here are a few common architectures:

### 1. Hierarchical Architecture

In a hierarchical architecture, there is a "manager" or "orchestrator" agent that is responsible for coordinating the work of other "worker" agents. The manager agent breaks down a high-level goal into smaller tasks and assigns them to the worker agents. This is a common and effective architecture for many problems.

### 2. Cooperative Architecture

In a cooperative architecture, all agents work together to achieve a common goal. There is no central controller, and agents communicate with each other to coordinate their actions. This is often used in scenarios where agents need to share information and resources.

### 3. Competitive Architecture

In a competitive architecture, agents have conflicting goals and compete with each other for resources. This is often used in game theory and in modeling economic systems.

## Example: A Multi-Agent Research Team

Imagine you want to write a research report on a new topic. You could use a multi-agent system to automate this process. The system could consist of the following agents:

*   **Research Agent:** This agent is responsible for searching the web and gathering relevant information.
*   **Writer Agent:** This agent takes the information gathered by the research agent and writes a draft of the report.
*   **Editor Agent:** This agent reviews the draft written by the writer agent, corrects any errors, and improves the overall quality of the report.
*   **Critique Agent:** This agent provides feedback on the report, suggesting areas for improvement.

These agents would work together, passing information back and forth, until they have produced a high-quality research report.

## Conclusion

Multi-agent systems are a powerful paradigm for building complex and intelligent systems. By understanding the different architectures and patterns for multi-agent interaction, you can start to design and build your own collaborative AI teams. In the next lesson, we will explore the crucial topic of memory and learning in agents.
