# Module 10 Assignment: Samsung EnnovateX Project Proposal

## Introduction
This is your final assignment. Your task is to create a complete and competitive project proposal for the Samsung EnnovateX AI Challenge, based on the "Always-On AI Companion" (Echo) we designed in the previous lesson.

## The Task
Create a detailed project proposal in the format of a GitHub repository `README.md` file. This proposal must be comprehensive enough to serve as a submission for Phase 1 of the challenge.

### Your `README.md` should contain the following sections:

1.  **Project Title:** Echo: The Untethered, Always-On AI Companion
2.  **Team Members:** (List your name)
3.  **Problem Statement:** Address Problem Statement #2. Describe the problem of modern smartphones being reactive tools rather than proactive partners. Explain the need for an "untethered" agent that respects privacy by operating fully on-device.
4.  **Our Solution: Echo**
    *   Provide a compelling narrative for Echo. Describe it as an agent that sees what you see, hears what you hear, and remembers your experiences to provide real-time, contextual help.
    *   Walk through the user journey/scenario from the previous lesson (the hardware store screw example).
5.  **Technical Implementation & Documentation**
    *   **Architecture:** Detail the agentic loop (Perceive -> Reason -> Act).
    *   **Components:** Describe the three core tools (`VisionTool`, `AudioTool`, `MemoryStream`) and the role of the on-device LLM as the reasoning core.
    *   **On-Device Strategy:** Explain *why* this must be on-device (privacy, latency) and how you would use an efficient model like Gemma 3n to achieve this.
6.  **UI/UX Design or User Interaction Design**
    *   Describe the novel H-AI model. The interaction is not command-based but proactive and contextual.
    *   Explain how Echo would deliver its suggestions (e.g., subtle notifications, haptic feedback, contextual information on a lock screen widget).
7.  **Ethical Considerations & Scalability**
    *   **Ethics:** Directly address the privacy implications of an "always-on" companion. Emphasize that all data and models are stored and run exclusively on-device, with no cloud connection.
    *   **Scalability:** Discuss how the agent's knowledge could grow over time within the constraints of the device's storage.
8.  **Demo Video Plan**
    *   Create a storyboard or script for a short (2-3 minute) video. The video should clearly demonstrate the hardware store screw scenario, showing both the user's actions and a visual representation of the agent's thought process (e.g., memory creation, contextual query, final suggestion).

## Submission
Structure your entire proposal in a single Markdown file. This is your blueprint for a winning entry. Good luck!
