# Lesson 2: Analyzing the Problem Statements

## Choosing Our Focus
The Samsung EnnovateX challenge offers several problem statements. Let's analyze the ones that align best with the principles of Agentic AI and Human-AI Interaction that we have learned.

### Problem Statement #1: Building the Next OS-Level AI Experience
- **Concept:** A single, powerful foundation model (like Gemma) as a firmware backbone in the OS. Other apps use small, efficient "adapters" to perform tasks.
- **Agentic Angle:** The OS itself becomes an agent, routing tasks and managing resources intelligently. This is a highly advanced, systems-level challenge.
- **Best For:** Students interested in OS architecture, model efficiency, and systems design.

### Problem Statement #2: Building the Untethered, Always-On AI Companion
- **Concept:** An agent that perceives the user's world through the phone's sensors ("sees what you see, hears what you hear") to provide proactive, contextual help without the cloud.
- **Agentic Angle:** This is the quintessential agentic AI problem. It requires a tight loop of perception, reasoning, and action, with a strong emphasis on memory.
- **Best For:** Students who want to build a truly personalized, context-aware assistant.

### Problem Statement #3: On-Device Multi-Agent System for Anomaly & Fraud Detection
- **Concept:** A team of agents running on-device, each monitoring a different aspect of user behavior (typing rhythm, app usage, etc.). They collaborate to detect anomalies.
- **Agentic Angle:** A direct application of the multi-agent systems we discussed. The novelty is in the on-device collaboration.
- **Best For:** Students interested in security, behavioral analysis, and multi-agent architectures.

### Problem Statement #4: On-Device Agentic System for Intelligent Battery Optimization
- **Concept:** An agent that actively monitors application and device usage to intelligently optimize battery life.
- **Agentic Angle:** The agent must be proactive and adaptive, making decisions that balance performance and battery longevity.
- **Best For:** Students interested in performance optimization and systems-level agent design.

### Problem Statement #6: Crafting the Next Generation of Human-AI Interaction on the Edge
- **Concept:** An open-ended challenge to create a solution with a novel, intuitive H-AI model.
- **Agentic Angle:** This is the core of our H-AI module. It allows for the most creativity in designing how humans and AI interact.
- **Best For:** Students focused on user experience, product design, and creating new interaction paradigms.

## Our Path Forward
For the rest of this module, we will focus on **Problem Statement #2: The Untethered, Always-On AI Companion**. It provides a perfect blend of agentic design, on-device challenges, and the need for novel H-AI.
