# Lesson 1: Understanding the Samsung EnnovateX AI Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the final and most challenging module of this course. We will be using a real-world competition, the **Samsung EnnovateX 2025 AI Challenge**, as our capstone project. This module will guide you through the process of understanding the rules, selecting a problem, and designing a competitive, agentic AI solution.

## Key Challenge Details
- **Timeline:** The challenge has strict deadlines. The final submission is due on **28 August, 2025**.
- **Format:** It's a two-phase challenge. Phase 1 is an online submission. The top 5 teams are invited to the on-site Grand Finale in Bengaluru.
- **Core Rule - No Cloud:** A critical rule is the prohibition of third-party APIs and cloud services. This means our entire solution must be capable of running **on-device**.
- **Submission:** All work must be in a public GitHub repository with an approved open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, or BSD 3-Clause).

## Why This Challenge?
This competition is the perfect test of the advanced concepts we've covered:
- **Agentic AI:** Many problem statements explicitly ask for "agents" or "companions."
- **On-Device Focus:** It forces us to think about efficiency, latency, and privacy, as discussed in our module on Edge AI.
- **Human-AI Interaction:** Several problems emphasize creating novel, intuitive user experiences.

In the next lesson, we will analyze the most relevant problem statements and choose a path for our project.
