# Requirements for the "Echo" AI Companion Project
# Note: The provided simulation script (echo_real_template.py) runs without these dependencies.
# This file lists the libraries a developer would need to build the full, functional application.

# --- Core AI/ML Libraries ---

# For running efficient, on-device deep learning models for vision and audio.
# tensorflow-lite-runtime

# For image and video processing, to prepare frames for the vision model.
# opencv-python-headless

# --- LLM / Generative AI ---

# The specific client library for the on-device LLM would go here.
# For example, if using a framework like Ollama to serve a Gemma model locally:
# ollama

# --- Memory & Data ---

# For creating and managing the on-device vector database (MemoryStream).
# A library like FAISS or a Python-based vector search library would be needed.
# faiss-cpu
# sentence-transformers # To generate embeddings for the vector search

# --- Utility ---

# Used for general numerical operations, especially with image data.
# numpy
