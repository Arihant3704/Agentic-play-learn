# 5. On-Device Strategy & Ethics

## 5.1. Why On-Device is Non-Negotiable
The entire premise of Echo is built on trust, which is only possible through an exclusively on-device architecture. The multi-agent system further reinforces these benefits:

-   **Privacy:** With the `PerceptionAgent` processing raw sensor data into high-level descriptions *on the device*, sensitive raw data never leaves the phone. All memory, reasoning, and action execution remain local.
-   **Latency:** The multi-agent architecture, with specialized agents handling perception and decision-making locally, ensures near-instantaneous response times. There are no network delays for critical safety alerts or proactive suggestions.
-   **Offline Capability:** Each agent operates independently on the device, allowing Echo to provide full functionality even without an internet connection.

## 5.2. Technical Approach for On-Device AI
-   **Models:** We will leverage highly efficient, quantized versions of state-of-the-art models. Gemma 3n is ideal for the `DecisionAgent`'s reasoning core. For the `PerceptionAgent`, efficient VLM architectures (e.g., MobileNetV3-based vision models combined with small language models for description generation) would be used.
-   **Memory Management:** The `MemoryStream` is designed for efficiency. It will use a rolling buffer, automatically summarizing older, less relevant memories into more abstract concepts to manage storage space over the long term.

## 5.3. Ethical Considerations
-   **Transparency:** The user will have access to a simple, readable log of all memories the agent has created and all suggestions/actions it has taken. 
-   **Control:** The user will have ultimate control. They can pause the agent's perception, delete specific memories, or wipe the entire `MemoryStream` at any time. There will be no ambiguity about who is in control.
-   **Bias:** The `PerceptionAgent`'s VLM models will be carefully evaluated for biases to ensure they perform fairly and accurately across diverse environments and for diverse users. The `DecisionAgent`'s prompts will be designed to mitigate LLM biases.
