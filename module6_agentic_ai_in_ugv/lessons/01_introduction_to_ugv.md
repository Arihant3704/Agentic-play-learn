# Lesson 1: Introduction to Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)

## What is a UGV?
An Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) is a vehicle that operates while in contact with the ground and without an onboard human presence. UGVs can be used for many applications where it may be inconvenient, dangerous, or impossible to have a human operator present.

## Types of UGVs
UGVs come in various sizes and configurations, tailored for different applications. Some common types include:
- **Tracked UGVs:** Offer stability and mobility on rough terrain.
- **Wheeled UGVs:** Faster and more efficient on flat surfaces like roads.
- **Legged UGVs:** Capable of navigating highly complex and uneven terrain, mimicking animal locomotion.

## Key Components of a UGV
- **Platform:** The physical body of the UGV, including chassis, wheels, tracks, or legs.
- **Sensors:** A suite of sensors to perceive the environment, such as cameras, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and IMUs.
- **Actuators:** Motors and other components that enable movement and interaction with the environment.
- **Control System:** The onboard computer that processes sensor data, makes decisions, and controls the actuators.
- **Communication Link:** For remote operation or for sending/receiving data.

## Applications of UGVs
- **Military:** Bomb disposal, surveillance, and reconnaissance.
- **Agriculture:** Automated planting, watering, and harvesting.
- **Logistics:** Warehouse automation and last-mile delivery.
- **Emergency Response:** Search and rescue operations in hazardous environments.
