# Lesson 2: Agentic AI for UGV Navigation

## The Challenge of Autonomous Navigation
For a UGV to operate autonomously, it must be able to navigate its environment safely and efficiently. This involves three core tasks:
1.  **Perception:** Understanding the surrounding environment from sensor data.
2.  **Localization:** Knowing its current position and orientation.
3.  **Path Planning:** Determining the best route to a destination while avoiding obstacles.

## How Agentic AI Helps
An agentic AI can act as the "brain" of the UGV, making intelligent decisions to navigate complex environments.

- **Perception:** The agent can use computer vision models to identify objects like roads, obstacles, and pedestrians from camera feeds. It can also fuse data from multiple sensors (e.g., LiDAR, radar) for a more robust understanding of the world.
- **Localization:** The agent can use algorithms like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to build a map of an unknown environment and simultaneously keep track of its position within that map.
- **Path Planning:** The agent can use planning algorithms (like A* or RRT) to find the optimal path. An agentic approach allows for more dynamic replanning. If an unexpected obstacle appears, the agent can reason about the new situation and generate a new plan on the fly.

## Example: An Agentic Navigation Loop
1.  **Goal:** The agent is given a goal, e.g., "Go to the charging station."
2.  **Perceive:** The agent analyzes data from its cameras and LiDAR.
3.  **Reason:** It identifies a clear path ahead but sees a new obstacle (e.g., a fallen box). It reasons that its original path is blocked.
4.  **Act:** The agent invokes its path planning tool to find a new route around the box. It then sends commands to the motors to follow this new path.
5.  **Repeat:** The loop continues until the goal is reached.
