# Lesson 3: UGV Mission Planning

## Beyond Navigation: Mission Execution
While navigation is a core capability, many UGV applications require the vehicle to perform a series of tasks to complete a mission. This is where high-level mission planning becomes critical.

## Agentic AI for Mission Planning
An agentic AI is perfectly suited for mission planning. It can take a high-level, abstract goal and decompose it into a sequence of concrete actions for the UGV to execute.

### Task Decomposition
Consider a mission like "Inspect the perimeter of the warehouse." An agentic AI could decompose this into:
1.  Generate a series of GPS waypoints that cover the warehouse perimeter.
2.  Navigate to the first waypoint.
3.  Activate the inspection camera and record video.
4.  Proceed to the next waypoint, continuing to record.
5.  Repeat until all waypoints are visited.
6.  Return to the starting point.
7.  Upload the recorded video to the central server.

### Dynamic Replanning and Error Handling
What if something goes wrong?
- **Low Battery:** If the agent detects low battery, it can pause the current mission, plan a path to the nearest charging station, charge itself, and then resume the mission.
- **Lost Communication:** If the communication link is lost, the agent can have a pre-defined protocol, such as returning to the last known point of good communication or completing the mission autonomously and uploading data once reconnected.

An agentic approach allows for this kind of intelligent, autonomous decision-making, making the UGV far more robust and reliable.
